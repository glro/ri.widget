RI Widget - Widget to search the Research Inventory's list of projects


1. Using the Research Inventory Widget ========================================

A full, simple example use of the RI widget can be found in snippet.html. The
short and sweet of it is:

ri.widget(document.getElementyById("ri-widget"));

This will wipe out the contents of the DOM element with id "ri-widget" and 
replace it with a search form. When submitted, this form will pop up a search
results box, hover over top of other content. The widget itself will respect the
width constraints imposed by its parent (the element with id "ri-widget" in
this case).

For a more complex example, consider we wish to make the following changes:
 - Use custom CSS that overrides the colours (a "theme")
 - Completely hide the widget when printed
 - Display 8 results, instead of the default 5
 - Use a different "close" image (at top right of result box)

For this we'll need to pass in some "options" to the ri.widget call. They are 
called options because they are precisely that, optional. The actual options
themselves are given as an object, where the properties correspond to the
options we're overriding. In this example, we would call ri.widget using 
something similar to this:

<div id="ri-widget">
  <a href="http://ri.ijc.org/">
    <img src="ri-banner.jpg" alt="Research Inventory" />
  </a>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript>
    ri.widget(document.getElementById("ri-widget"), {
        items: 8,
        stylesheets: ri.widget.settings.stylesheets.concat([
            { href: "/css/ri-widget-theme.css" },
            { href: "/css/ri-widget-print.css", media: "print" }
        ]),
        images: {
            close: {
                url: "/images/my-close.png", w: 30, h: 30, trans: true, alt: "X"
            }
        }
    });
</script>


2. Supported Browsers =========================================================

Every effort is made to be as cross-platform as possible. However, only the 
following browsers are used during testing:

- Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 (Windows only)
- Firefox 3 and 3.5 (Linux and Windows)
- Opera 10 (Linux and Windows)
- Safari 4 (Windows only)
- Google Chrome (Windows only)

Known issues with browser support:

* MSIE "quirks mode" is NOT supported. Please ensure your page has a DOCTYPE.

* The widget has rounded borders on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome (and any other 
browser that supports border-radius, or the corresponding mozilla or webkit 
vendor extensions). I think it looks nice and hope to add support for IE and 
Opera soon.

* Currently, browser sniffing is done to fix PNG transparency issues in MSIE 6.
Any "image" in the ri.widget's images option that has a property "trans" set to
true will be "fixed," so it is important to add that property to any transparent
PNGs you are using.
